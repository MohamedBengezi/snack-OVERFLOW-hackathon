### About:
This was developed as a hackathon project for IBM interns. The goal of this project was to create a chat that used sentiment  and tone analysis to detect how a conversation between an L2/L3 support and a customer is going. It does so by highlighting various statements made by both parties in colours each corresponding to a different emotion. The aim was to assist and teach L2/L3 support agents how to navigate with customers.

### Requirements:
1. Python 3
2. Access to IBM Watson

### How to run:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python3 chat.py`
4. Open http://localhost:5000 to open the app
